Google maps Airport High-Resolution Satellite Imagery

We have undertaken an extensive effort to collect a comprehensive dataset of high-resolution satellite images capturing various airport landscapes. The dataset encompasses a wide range of image sizes, ranging from 1500 by 1500 pixels to 6000 by 6000 pixels, ensuring the inclusion of both detailed and expansive airport views. Within this dataset, we have meticulously labeled a total of 4204 runway instances, employing a rigorous and meticulous labeling process.

Our dataset comprises satellite images sourced from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), covering diverse geographical locations throughout the United States. This deliberate selection ensures a broad representation of airport settings, accommodating different airport sizes, runway shapes, and surrounding environments. By incorporating such diversity, our dataset offers a comprehensive and representative sample for training and testing object detection models specifically designed for airport runway detection using satellite imagery.

We are confident that our meticulously curated dataset will significantly contribute to the advancement of the field. It provides researchers and practitioners with a valuable resource to train and evaluate object detection models with an emphasis on airport runway detection. By leveraging the diversity within the dataset, researchers can develop more accurate, robust, and efficient models that effectively identify and locate runways in satellite imagery.

Through the utilization of our dataset, we envision enhanced capabilities in airport infrastructure analysis, aviation safety assessments, and related applications. We believe that our efforts in collecting and sharing this dataset will foster innovation, collaboration, and further exploration within the domain of airport runway detection using satellite imagery.

We are excited to present this dataset to the research community and industry professionals, and we anticipate its positive impact on the development of advanced models and solutions in this crucial field.
